Reboot once, the partition for OMV will be be auto-resized. A third partition on the SD card will be created, but without a filesystem, check it out with lsblk command. Remember the name of the partition.\nTo add a filesystem to this partition use :\nmkfs.ext4 -L \u0026lt;your-label\u0026gt; /dev/\u0026lt;the-partition-name\u0026gt;\r You can now go to the Web Console -\u0026gt; Storage -\u0026gt; File Systems, locate the new partition and Mount it.

Haven't tried it yet, but it's quite possible you can power up to 4 HDDs this way and use them all with a single Pi.\nJust plug the HDD in the hub, the hub into wall power and the Pi - you're ready to go.

You might also need to go to Access Right Management -\u0026gt; User and add a new user, click Privileges and grant the new user access to the shared folder.\nOn Windows you can now open Explorer and Map network drive. Put in an address like \\\\192.168.1.176\\my-share. If all was right, it should ask you for login/password. Check the box log in using different credentials and supply the username and password for the user that you've just created through OMV admin web page.\nSetting up backup of your cloud-based storage to the local HDD connected to Pi Log in to RPi from ssh. Install RClone (https://rclone.org). Worked fine from the script installation for me. Run rclone configure to set up Google Drive integration.

Getting started GPG signing  Windows caveat   Configuring Maven to know where to get the signing key Configuring Maven to know the credentials for Sonatype servers Satisfying requirements to pass all checks upon submission to Sonatype Publishing parent POM project to Central Publishing the project to Central   What is Sonatype and why is it needed? Sonatypeis a company that provides a staging repository, which performs validation and allows to push the builds that pass all checks to the Central repo. Without it, basically, you can't easily publish anything to the Central easily, unless you're an Apache project or similar.\nGetting started Follow their getting started guide to set up the needed credentials. This should be easy - you create a JIRA account and you create a ticket in JIRA to claim your namespace (groupId in Maven terms). If you have a github account, for example,  http://github.com/chhh , you'll want to claim com.github.chhh.\nGPG signing You'll need to set up and publish your GPG key for signing artifacts. This is described here .\nIn short you'll need to install gpg or gpg2. I did it on Windows and already had a working gpg that came with git installation. So I happily used that to generate my key with (create it with a passphrase!):\ngpg --gen-key\nMake sure to check that the generated key does not have sub keys for signing. First issue gpg --list-keys, the output should be like:\n$ gpg --list-keys /c/Users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/.gnupg/pubring.gpg --------------------------------- pub 2048R/DA123C12 2012-01-24 uid Dmitry Avtonomov (chhh) \u0026lt;email@gmail.com\u0026gt; sub 2048R/3E123123 2012-01-24  Notice, that there is one pub key and one sub key. You want this sub key to not be Usage: C type. gpg --edit-key DA123C12\ngpg (GnuPG) 1.4.20; Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc. This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Dmitry Avtonomov (chhh) \u0026lt;email@gmail.com\u0026gt;  In this case the sub key is usage: E, it's used for encryption only, so we're good to go, otherwise you'd need to delete or revoke it. Published the key with:\ngpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys \u0026lt;key-id\u0026gt;\nWindows caveat The previous steps created the keychain file in c:/Users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/.gnupg. However, when I later installed the native windows gpg from https://www.gnupg.org/download/ I've found that it used a different default path and I could not list the key anymore. Addind a new environment variable GNUPGHOME and set it to C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\\.gnupg. Now the gpg that was installed in windows could read the old keychain, which meant maven could now use that key to sign files.\nConfiguring Maven to know where to get the signing key Check out your \u0026lt;maven-install-apth\u0026gt;/conf directory. There should be a settings.xml file. Copy that over to your \u0026lt;user-home\u0026gt;/.m2, unless you already have it there. Add the following to \u0026lt;profiles\u0026gt;:\n\u0026lt;profiles\u0026gt; \u0026lt;profile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;ossrh\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;activation\u0026gt; \u0026lt;activeByDefault\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/activeByDefault\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/activation\u0026gt; \u0026lt;properties\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gpg.executable\u0026gt;gpg\u0026lt;/gpg.executable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gpg.passphrase\u0026gt;passphrase-you-used-when-created-gpg-key\u0026lt;/gpg.passphrase\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/properties\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/profile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/profiles\u0026gt;  It's ok to have your passphrase set here as this is your user-specific configuration file. If you don't want to specify that, however, there will be an option for you to provide that passphrase every time you publish.\nConfiguring Maven to know the credentials for Sonatype servers You'll provide the log-in credentials in the same settings.xml maven file in ~/.m2 directory. If you don't want to provide the actual username and password, log in to your account at https://oss.sonatype.org . In the top right corner click Log-In, then click your username and select Profile. On the new screen there's a dropdown with two choices: Summary and User Token. Select the user token, it will give you the info. In the settings.xml file add:\n\u0026lt;servers\u0026gt; \u0026lt;server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;ossrh\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;user-name-token\u0026lt;/username\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;password-for-token\u0026lt;/password\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/servers\u0026gt;  Satisfying requirements to pass all checks upon submission to Sonatype There's a lot of meta-info required to satisfy all the requirements. As you will be using the same groupId for all your artifacts, it's easier to put all the extra information to a parent POM. You can find an example parent project here: https://github.com/chhh/sonatype-ossrh-parent . This project consists only of the POM file, specifying the credentials, basic info and publishing locations. It adds some to the release target as well.\nIt's ok to just clone that repo and change the information to what you like. You will set this POM as the \u0026lt;parent\u0026gt; of the projects you wish to publish to Central. As it will be the parent POM, anyone who will want to build your artifacts will need to have that POM, so the first thing is to publish this project to Central by itself.\nPublishing parent POM project to Central We'll be using maven-release plugin. Make sure that:\n You have SCM information configured. In this parent POM you set the version to something like 0.1-SNAPSHOT.  The release plugin will use that information to create the build. It will remove the SNAPSHOT part, build the project, create a new tag in SCM, push everything to remote, bump up the version in POM and re-add SNAPSHOT back to it.

It is written in Java and built on top of the NetBeans Platform .\nDemo Video Here's a short demo video of BatMass in action.\n  Some Examples The layout of windows is free and customizable by dragging. Compare multiple experiments at once. The bottom-middle run in this figure is a blank (no sample was injected), while the other 5 were runs with some sample. Amazing how much stuff comes from the background. And here are the same runs but zoomed in to a small region of m/z and retentino time. Look at the color-marked regions. Let's just accept that zero-values are a thing, there is no need to try extracting noise to do gap-filling in data. Features   Support for the open standard mzML and mzXML mass spectrometry data types. We are hoping to bring native vendor format support as well.\n  Viewer synchronization. Link any number of viewers and zooming/panning will be synchronized across them. If you're viewing MS1 data in one view and MS2 data in the other the retention time is synchronized, while m/z is not. Open a detected LC/MS feature table or a peptide identification table, a double click on the row will open the corresponding spectrum, or bring you to the corresponding location in a 2D Map viewer.\n  Data access layer. For the Java developers out there, the highly optimized mzML/mzXML parsers can be used in any standalone Java program as a simple jar dependency. Parsing has been manually tuned to produce few garbage objects, thus minimizing time spent in GC (Garbage Collection), the speed is comparable to or better than in C/C++ implementations. The API for LC/MS data files gives access to most of the features supported by mzML/mzXML standards.\n  Referencing the work If you use BatMass for your research or work, please cite the following paper:\n Avtonomov D.M. et al: J.

An \u0026ldquo;Open Search\u0026rdquo; is any search of fragmentation spectra (MS2) against a protein database when the precursor mass tolerance was set to a high enough value. E.g. not the usual 5-10-20 ppm, but instead 50-100-200 Da. The result of such a search is quite different from the regular one, it might contain a lot of spurious hits, but a lot of hits will still correspond to reasonable matches.\nThe differences in mass between the observed value for a precursor and the theoretical peptide mass from a database might be many Daltons. Nevertheless, you'll still see lots of similar mass differences, which should correspond to Post Translational Modifications (PTMs) or chemical modifications or other artifacts in the data.\nAfter performing an Open Search you might want to identify the differences to maybe include them into the variable modifications list of your search engine settings. You might also discover unexpected artifacts, like chemical derivatives of peptides occurring because of your sample preparation protocols etc.\nThis is where this program comes into play.\nReferencing work / Citing If you have used this software in your work or research, please cite:\n   Manuscript   Dmitry M.
