abstract = { Top-down proteomics has emerged as a transformative method for the analysis of protein sequence and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Top-down experiments have historically been performed primarily on ultra-high resolution mass spectrometers due to the complexity of spectra resulting from fragmentation of intact proteins, but recent advances in coupling ion mobility separations to faster, lower resolution mass analyzers now offer a viable alternative. However, software capable of interpreting the highly complex 2-dimensional spectra that result from coupling ion mobility separation to top-down experiments is currently lacking. In this manuscript we present a software suite consisting of 2 programs, IMTBX ("IM Toolbox") and Grppr ("Grouper"), which enable fully automated processing of such data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this software suite by examining a series of intact proteins on a Waters Synapt G2 ion-mobility equipped mass spectrometer, and compare the results to the manual and semi-automated data analysis procedures we have used previously. }
