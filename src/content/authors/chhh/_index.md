Best way to describe myself would be: 
a software engineer with a lot of hands on experience in mass-spectrometry
(liquid and gas chromatography, ion mobility).

Usual course of action - acquire new data, explore it with visualizations,
come up with a suitable processing algorithm. In most cases this results in
desktop GUI applications for the viz part and CLI programs to perform batch
data processing.

Prefer writing code in Java (with Gradle and Maven) or C#, with occasional 
forays into C++. Contributing to Open Source projects like 
[Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/). Sharing through Maven Central.

Some project links: 
- [BatMass](http://batmass.org) - Mass spectrometry data visualization and processing (__Java, NetBeans Platform__).
- [FragPipe](https://github.com/nesvilab/fragpipe) - Pipelined complete LC/MS proteomic analysis with a graphical interface.
Peptide/protein search, validation, FDR estimation, quantitation, PTM analysis, spectral library building etc (__Java, Swing__).
- [MSFragger](https://msfragger.nesvilab.org/) - Ultra-fast proteomics search engine for Closed and Open searches (__Java__).
- [MSFTBX](https://github.com/chhh/msftbx) - Java library for unified mass-spec data access: mzML, mzXML, pepXML, protXML, mzId, mzIdentML, etc. Available through Maven Central (__Java, gRPC__).
- [IMTBX+Grppr](https://chhh.github.io/IMTBX) - A suite of tools for extracting signals from Ion Mobility (IM) data (IM-MS, LC-IM-MS) and performing isotopic envelopes detection (__C#, WinForms, Java__).
- [DIA-Umpire](http://diaumpire.sourceforge.net/) - Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) data processing tool that doesn't require a spectral library (Java).
