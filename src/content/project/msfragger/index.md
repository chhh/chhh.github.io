summary: Ultra-fast proteomics search engine. Regular searches - when the precursor
  mass is limited to a narrow window of several ppm - are done within a few seconds.
  An "open-search" (with large precursor mass range tolerance, e.g. +/-500 Da) for
  a 2 hour LC gradient bottom-up proteomics experiment can be done in a minute or
  so on a laptop.
