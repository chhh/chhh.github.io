[DIA-Umpire](http://diaumpire.sourceforge.net/) - Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) data processing tool that doens't require a spectral library. Detects features in MS1 and MS2, correlates precursors to fragments based on elution profile similarity and compiles pseudo-MS/MS spectra from these groups, which can later be searched with standard proteomic search tools.
- Efficient calculation of isotopic fine structure up to predefined aggregated probability.
