# Biography

Dmitry Avtonomov is a Postdoc at [Alexey Neshvizhskii's Lab](http://nesvilab.org) at the University of Michgan. The main area of research is everything related to mass spectrometry data processing


I started my scientific career at Prof. Eugene Nikolaev's Ion Physics lab in Moscow. The lab hosted a slew of mass-spectrometers, including Thermo LTQ-FT Ultra, Bruker Microflex, Bruker Apex QE, an in-house built 4.7T ICR and multiple ion traps.  
During this period the primary research projects included:

- Setting up the lab for routine proteomics operations:
  - in-house designed and manufactured Nano-ESI ion source
  - manufacturing of spraying columns for HPLC (ESI spraying tip integrated with the chromatographic column)
  - setting up database search resources (Mascot server at the time)
- Negative ion source development for ETD (Electron Transfer Dissociation)
  - in-house designed and installed into Finningan LCQ Deca XP
- Supercomputer modeling of ion cloud movement in electric and magnetic field
  - for simulation of ion cloud motion in ICR mass spectrometers
- Development of algorithms for peptide retention time alignment across multiple runs

After finishing PhD at the Ion Physics lab, joined [Alexey Neshvizhskii's Lab](http://nesvilab.org) at the University of Michgan with a shift from hardware to software. I develop Java applications with occasional pieces in C#, Python and C++.

- BatMass - mass spectrometry data visualization and processing tool on NetBeans platform
- MSFTBX - a fast Java library for mass spectrometry data files access
- DIA-Umpire - a tool for Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) data processing. Detects features in MS1 and MS2, correlates precursors to fragments based on elution profile similarity and compiles pseudo-MS/MS spectra from these groups, which can later be searched with standard proteomic search tools.
- Efficient calculation of isotopic fine structure up to predefined aggregated probability
- Better signal processing for Ion Mobility (IM) / Liquid Chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry. Multidimensional feature detection (ion mobility, retention time, m/z).
